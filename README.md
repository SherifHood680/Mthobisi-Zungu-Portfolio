**Live Site:** [https://sherifhood680.github.io/Mthobisi-Zungu-Portfolio/](https://sherifhood680.github.io/Mthobisi-Zungu-Portfolio/)

Welcome to the source code of my professional portfolio. This project represents a complete migration from a legacy HTML/CSS site to a modern, high-performance web application built with a cutting-edge developer stack.

## 🪐 Mission Brief
As a **Junior Software Engineer** with a background in **Physical Sciences (Mathematics & Physics)**, I bridge the gap between scientific rigor and software engineering. I build software centered on first-order principles, focusing on robust architectures, automation, and high-performance interfaces.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Deployment:** [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) & [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## 🔋 Key Features
- **Sophisticated Hero Experience:** Advanced parallax background featuring deep-layered portraits with ambient glow and smooth scroll-based transitions.
- **Premium "About" Section:** A glassmorphic design featuring animated stats, original color portraits, and a senior-level scientific narrative.
- **Modern UI/UX:** A high-end dark-theme aesthetic with responsive layouts and vibrant micro-interactions.
- **Dynamic Experience Timeline:** Visual representation of professional growth and educational background.
- **Interactive Project Showcase:** Featured project cards with status badges and deep-link integration.
- **Fully Automated CI/CD:** Integrated GitHub Actions for automatic builds and deployment.
