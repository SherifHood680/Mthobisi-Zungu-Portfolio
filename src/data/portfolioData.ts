    about: [
        "I bridge the gap between scientific rigor and software engineering. With a BSc in Physical Sciences, I don't just write code; I architect systems centered on first-order principles. My background in the physical sciences has instilled a methodical precision and an analytical lens that allows me to decompose complex organizational challenges into elegant, scalable technical solutions.",
        "My expertise lies in building resilient backend architectures and high-performance interfaces. From developing automated enterprise-level attendance systems integrated with Microsoft Graph API to engineering AI-driven career platforms, I focus on creating software that is as robust as it is efficient. I thrive at the intersection of Python's power and JavaScript's flexibility, always with an eye toward type-safety and system maintainability.",
        "What sets me apart is a commitment to depth. Driven by a deep-seated curiosity about how systems function at scale, I bring a scientist's discipline to the full software development lifecycle—from initial requirements analysis to testing and deployment. I am looking to contribute to forward-thinking teams where precision, logic, and rapid innovation are the standard."
